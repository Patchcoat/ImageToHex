# ImageToHex
A program that converts a black-and-white image to hex values for a black and white LCD

This program is specifically built for creating a list of hex values that can be loaded onto a PCD8544 LCD. It is highly specialized. The input and output files are hard-coded. The input image needs to match the resolution, and it only works with images that contain two colors, black and white. Grey doesn't work, colors don't work. However, this is a solid enough starting point that such features would be trivial to add.
