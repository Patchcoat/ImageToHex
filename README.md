# ImageToHex
A program that converts a black-and-white image to hex values for a black and white LCD

This program is specifically built for a PCD8544 LCD and is highly specialized. The input image needs to match the resolution, and it only works with images that contain two colors, black and white. Grey doesn't work, colors don't work. However, this is a solid enough starting point that such features would be trivial to add.
